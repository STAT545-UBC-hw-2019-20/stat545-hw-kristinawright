3 countries picked from the filtered results and refiltered for Greece, Austria, and Philippines within the 1970's.  A new table 'gapminder1.1' is made:

```r
gapminder1.1 <- (gapminder %>%
  filter(country == 'Greece' | country == 'Austria' | country == 'Philippines', year == 1970:1979))
knitr::kable(gapminder1.1)
```



country       continent    year   lifeExp        pop   gdpPercap
------------  ----------  -----  --------  ---------  ----------
Austria       Europe       1977     72.17    7568430   19749.422
Greece        Europe       1972     72.34    8888628   12724.830
Philippines   Asia         1977     60.06   46850962    2373.204

## 1.2 

Variables country and gdpPercap only shown from gapminder1.1:

```r
knitr::kable(gapminder1.1 %>%
  select(country, gdpPercap))
```



country        gdpPercap
------------  ----------
Austria        19749.422
Greece         12724.830
Philippines     2373.204

## 1.3

To filter gapminder to all rows that have a drop in life expectancy a new temporary variable of countrylag containing country values shifted one row down is made.
A new variable of increase in life expectancy is made from the difference in life expectancy between each year in order of country and year. Country and countrylag values are compared.  If they are not equal then its value is replaced with 0.  Increase in life expectancy is filtered for drop in life expectancy by filtering for negative values only. Countrylag is removed from the table.


```r
DT::datatable(gapminder %>%
  mutate(countrylag = lag(country, order_by = country & year)) %>%
  mutate(increaseLifeExp = lag(diff(gapminder$lifeExp), order_by = country & year)) %>%
  mutate(increaseLifeExp = if_else( country == countrylag, increaseLifeExp, 0)) %>%
  filter(increaseLifeExp < 0) %>%
  select(-countrylag))
```

## 1.4

To filter gapminder to find the rows with the 3 largest and 3 smallest GDP per capita you can:

Find the number of rows in gapminder:

```r
nrow(gapminder)
```

```
## [1] 1704
```
 
Arrange gapminder in descending order for GDP per capita, then select top 3 rows and bottom 3 rows:


```r
knitr::kable((gapminder %>%
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap)))[c(1:3, 1702:1704), ])
```

Here is a summary of the data for continent and population variables:

```r
summary(gapminder %>%
          select(continent, pop))
```

```
##     continent        pop           
##  Africa  :624   Min.   :6.001e+04  
##  Americas:300   1st Qu.:2.794e+06  
##  Asia    :396   Median :7.024e+06  
##  Europe  :360   Mean   :2.960e+07  
##  Oceania : 24   3rd Qu.:1.959e+07  
##                 Max.   :1.319e+09
```

```r
1.319e+09 - 6.001e+04
```

```
## [1] 1318939990
```

The possible values for continent are Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.  Population has a maximum value of 1.319e+09 and a minimum value of 6.001e+04 with a range of 1318939990. 

The following graph represents the population of each continent from 1951-2007:


```r
ggplot(gapminder, aes(continent, pop)) +
  geom_col() 
```

![](hw02_dplyr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->
Asia has the largest population, while Oceania has the smallest population of the 5 categories.  Africa, Americas, and Europe have somewhat similar population levels relative to Asia and Oceania.


## 3


Exploration of Loblolly pine trees.  Here is a scatterplot of height (ft) vs. age (yr):


```r
ggplot(Loblolly, aes(age, height)) +
         geom_point(colour = 'magenta')
```

![](hw02_dplyr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

Here is a bar graph of height (ft) vs. seed source:


```r
ggplot(Loblolly, aes(Seed, height)) +
         geom_col()
```

![](hw02_dplyr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

Seed type 305 appears to have the highest trees, while seed type 329 has the shortest.

## Recycling

No, the following code is incorrect to get data for Rwanda and Afghanistan:

```r
filter(gapminder, country == c("Rwanda", "Afghanistan"))
```

Because creating multiple entries means both values will not be check for the condition to be true. This is the correct way to check for both:

```r
filter(gapminder, country == "Rwanda" | country == "Afghanistan")
```
